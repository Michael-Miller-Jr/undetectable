# Undetectable

![icon128](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab0ba65-415a-4747-80f0-dcbf983f2962)

**Undetectable** is a Chrome extension designed to work alongside your ad blocker - not replace it. While it doesn't block ads itself, it helps prevent websites from detecting that you're using an ad blocker. By simulating normal ad behavior, spoofing common detection methods, and hiding anti-adblock warnings, it keeps your browsing smooth and uninterrupted. All detection attempts are logged locally, and you stay in control with a clean, user-friendly popup and options interface.

For the sake of clarity: When the description says it "simulates normal ad behavior" or "spoofs normal ads," it means that the extension:
- Creates decoy ad elements like `<div class="adsbygoogle">` or `<ins class="ad-slot">` that look like real ads to detection scripts.
- Fakes global ad variables like window.adsbygoogle or window.google_ad_status so scripts that try to detect whether ads are loading see values that indicate ads are loading.
- Overrides or fills in attributes like data-ad-status="unfilled" → "filled" to make the page believe ads successfully loaded.

This tricks anti-adblock scripts into thinking ads are working normally, even though your ad blocker is still quietly blocking them in the background.

So to clarify: the extension doesn’t block or display real ads, but it fakes the presence of ads just enough to fool detection mechanisms. That’s the key to staying “undetectable.”

## 💡 Why This Exists
The author of this extension believes users should have the freedom to browse the internet without constant interruptions or coercive messaging. Just as individuals can walk down a street and choose to ignore advertisements in the physical world, they should be able to do the same online.

Undetectable was created to support this principle:
A quiet, respectful browsing experience where users - not aggressive scripts or popup warnings - remain in control.

This tool isn't about circumventing fair monetization; it's about pushing back against disruptive, invasive practices that degrade the web experience.

🧱 Works Best With These Ad Blockers
Undetectable is designed to complement popular ad blockers, not replace them. It works best when used alongside the following:

- **uBlock Origin**
Lightweight and highly customizable, with minimal resource usage.

- **Adblock Plus**
Widely used and easy to configure, with options for filter subscriptions.

- **Ghostery**
Focuses on privacy and tracker blocking, with some ad-blocking capabilities.

- **Brave Browser (Built-in Shield)**
Built-in ad and tracker blocking, which Undetectable enhances by helping suppress detection prompts.

- **Privacy Badger**
Created by the EFF, this tool blocks trackers and some ads based on behavior.

These tools handle the blocking. Undetectable ensures you don’t get hassled for using them.

## 🛠️ Installation

To protect your privacy and avoid detection, **Undetectable must be loaded manually as an unpacked extension**:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

Undetectable will now appear in your toolbar and work silently across supported sites.

## ❓ Why Load as Unpacked?

### 🚫 Avoid Extension Fingerprinting

Chrome Web Store extensions have **permanent, globally known IDs**. Websites can detect these using:

- Requests to `chrome-extension://<ID>/`
- JS fingerprinting and DOM probes
- Known file or behavior signatures

**Unpacked extensions use randomized IDs**, making detection virtually impossible.

---

### 🔒 Avoid Store Restrictions & Auto-Updates

Google prohibits or limits functionality like:

- Spoofing detection variables
- Blocking adblock popups
- Interfering with ad scripts

By remaining unpacked:

- ✅ Avoids extension takedowns or forced restrictions  
- ✅ Retains complete privacy and control  
- ✅ Developer decides when and how the extension is updated, end users must update for new features and improvements

## ⚙️ Permissions Used

```json
{
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
}
```

- `storage`: For saving toggle states and detection logs.  
- `<all_urls>`: Needed to run stealth logic on any site (excluding YouTube, which uses its own logic).

---

## 🔐 Safe and Secure Practices

### ✅ 1. No Remote Code Execution  
- All scripts (e.g., `universal-stealth.js`, `youtube-stealth.js`) are locally stored and listed in `manifest.json`.  
- No use of `eval()`, `new Function()`, or dynamic script loading from external sources.

### ✅ 2. Minimal and Appropriate Permissions

```json
{
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
}
```

- `storage` is used solely for saving logs and user settings.  
- `<all_urls>` is justified due to the extension’s purpose of detecting and preventing adblock triggers across the web.

### ✅ 3. No Access to Sensitive APIs  
The extension does **not** use or request:  
- `tabs.executeScript`  
- `cookies`  
- `webRequest`  
- `history`  
- `identity` or `sessions`

### ✅ 4. Local-Only Logging  
- Detection logs are saved using `chrome.storage.local`.  
- No data is ever sent externally.  
- Logs can be viewed, cleared, or exported at any time.

### ✅ 5. Clean UI Input Handling  
- No user input is parsed or inserted into the DOM unsafely.  
- All UI elements (toggles, buttons) are strictly scoped and simple.

### ⚠️ Areas to Note (Safe but Worth Awareness)

- **`chrome.tabs.query()` in `popup.js`**  
  Used only to reload the current tab.  
  Does **not** require `tabs` permission under MV3 and does **not** access tab content.

- **Global Spoofing (`adsbygoogle`, `google_ad_status`)**  
  These are spoofed for stealth, which is effective but can be caught by aggressive detection scripts.  
  This is a stealth-evasion tradeoff, not a security concern.

- **`<all_urls>` Access**  
  While necessary, this is a broad permission. It’s safe because:  
  - Doesn’t fetch or execute external scripts  
  - Avoids unsafe APIs  
  - Doesn’t manipulate sensitive page content

---

### ❌ No Known Insecure Patterns

Avoided:  
- `eval()` or `setTimeout('code', ...)`  
- Inline script execution  
- External tracking or analytics  
- Untrusted user input parsing

---

### ✅ Final Verdict

This extension is secure, responsible, and well-designed.  
It follows modern Chrome Extension best practices for:  
- Script isolation  
- Local-only storage  
- Controlled permissions  
- Passive enhancement without violating user trust

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Prevent YouTube’s adblock warning overlays  
- Stop annoying popups on blogs or news sites  
- Log which sites are trying to detect ad blockers  
- Keep music playing in the background without interruptions

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Site-specific enable/disable toggle  
- Dark mode UI  
- Optional remote sync or import/export rules  
- Smarter fingerprint evasion
